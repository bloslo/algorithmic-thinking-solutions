Solutions to the problems from the book Algorithmic Thinking: A Problem-Based Introduction by Daniel Zingaro.

To run a solution, first change directory to the specific
problem solution. Then create a `bin` folder:

```
mkdir bin
```

Compile the source code to produce an executable:

```
gcc <solution-filename>.c -o bin/<solution-filename>
```

Run the executable:

```
./bin/<solution-filename>
```
